# **Observer Pattern**

Observer design pattern is one of the `behavioural design pattern`.

Observer design pattern is useful where you are interested in the state of an object and want to get notified whenever there is any change.

In Observer Pattern, object that watch on the state of another object are called `Observer`, and the object that is being watched is called `Observable`.
